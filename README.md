# Function:
When we want a group of statements to be executed as per requirement multiple times or ones then we write a block of code and this is nothing but a Function.
Syntax: def function_name():
        statement
When using function we have to follow 2 steps:
1. Declaring the function
def simple():
    print('Hello')
2. Calling the function  #To get output calling is needed.
simple()
In python there are TWO types of function: 1) Builtin 2) user defined.
